### Q1 Vehicle Showroom - Java

Navigate or ```cd``` to the ```q1_VehicleShowroom_Java\``` directory from a terminal

Simply run the program using: ```java VehicleShowroom```.


**Please note that:**
- Source Java files are already compiled and don't require ```javac``` beforehand (I think).
- Console options are taken as numbers (type in the number then press enter).
- The ~1 second delay after each console print is intentional and for the user to notice the text.
- The ```VehicleShowroom.java``` can also be run using VS Code's *"Run and Debug"* button.
